# JAAC Pizza Delivery Game

The aim of this project is to create a complex, visually appealing, and challenging obstacle game in the form of a pizza delivery simulator without using a designated game engine. The user will play as an employee at the pizza establishment Jaques Pizza, whose objective it will be to deliver each pizza by completing a corresponding level. The levels will be structured as side scrolling strips of road, with an arbitrary number of lanes and vehicles moving from the right side of the screen to the left. By moving up and down between lanes, the player will avoid these vehicles to reach the end of the level as quickly as possible and without losing health.

Games within this genre have often been relegated to the mobile gaming scene, with popular examples like Temple Run, Crossy Road, and Jetpack Joyride. Jacque’s Pizza Delivery, however, will be run on the console on PC, differentiating it from these games in the way that its controls will be through mouse and keyboard rather than via touch screen. 

Our aim is to recreate the feeling of playing a flash game in the 2000’s on websites like Friv, without necessitating the use of a web browser. Jacque’s Pizza will be a simple, fun, and challenging way to pass time on the user’s personal computer without the need for an internet connection.
